# SRT-color-changer
Simple script for highlighting subtitles in an SRT file

This small python program is perfect for video creators and cutters, that are creating Tiktok clips, Instagramm Reels or YouTube Shorts.
It helps you to highlight specific words in an SRT-file which can be used for working with subtitles.

## How to use SRT Color Changer?
When you are working on subtitles in your video editing software and they appear at the right timestamps, you should be able to export your subtitles as an *.srt-file*.

- Save the *.srt* to any folder you like.
- Make sure to have Python installed on your PC. For Windows you can simply install it from the Microsoft Store: https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NCVDN91XZQP?hl=de-de&gl=US
- Download the **srt_colorchanger.py** file (Your Browser may warn you because .py-files can be used for bad things, but not this one)
- Simply double-click to start **srt_colorchanger.py**
- Follow the instructions in the terminal

The program will create a new *.srt-file*, which then can be imported back into your video cutting program.
